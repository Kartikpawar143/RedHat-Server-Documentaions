## End of Part 2A

# Part 2B-1 – Extracting, Understanding and Configuring Nagios Core

---

# 16. Extracting the Source Code

## Objective

After downloading the Nagios Core source code archive, the next step is to extract it into a working directory.

The downloaded archive is a compressed **tar.gz** file containing the complete Nagios Core source code.

---

## What is a tar.gz File?

A **tar.gz** file is a compressed archive commonly used in Linux.

It consists of two stages:

```
Source Files
      │
      ▼
 TAR Archive (.tar)
      │
      ▼
 GZIP Compression (.gz)
      │
      ▼
 file.tar.gz
```

The `.tar` package groups files together, while `.gz` compresses the package to reduce download size.

---

## Verify the Download

Navigate to the download directory.

```bash
cd /usr/src
```

List the downloaded file.

```bash
ls -lh
```

Example Output

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2.5M nagios.tar.gz
```

---

## Check File Type

```bash
file nagios.tar.gz
```

Expected Output

```
nagios.tar.gz: gzip compressed data
```

---

## Extract the Archive

Run:

```bash
tar -xzf nagios.tar.gz
```

### Command Explanation

| Option | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| x | Extract archive |
| z | Use gzip decompression |
| f | Read from file |

---

## Verify Extraction

```bash
ls
```

Example

```
nagios.tar.gz

nagioscore-nagios-4.5.13
```

---

## Change Directory

```bash
cd nagioscore-nagios-4.5.13
```

Verify

```bash
pwd
```

Example

```
/usr/src/nagioscore-nagios-4.5.13
```
<img width="1312" height="146" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4455bcc-6154-47c5-9f89-a76e5f56eeaf" />

---

## Why Extract in /usr/src?

Linux follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).

```
/
├── bin
├── boot
├── etc
├── home
├── opt
├── usr
│   └── src
│       └── nagioscore-nagios-4.5.13
└── var
```

Advantages

- Standard build location
- Easy cleanup
- Does not interfere with installed applications
- Used by most source installations

---

## Common Errors

### Error

```
tar: Cannot open: No such file
```

Cause

Wrong filename.

Solution

```
ls
```

Verify the exact filename.

---

### Error

```
gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
```

Cause

Corrupted download.

Solution

Download the archive again.

---

## Best Practice

# 18. Configuring Nagios

## Objective

Before compiling Nagios, the system must be checked for required libraries, compilers and dependencies.

This process is performed using the **configure** script.

---

## What is configure?

The configure script automatically checks

- Compiler
- Libraries
- Header files
- Operating System
- SSL
- Apache
- GD Library
- User Accounts

After successful verification, it creates a customized **Makefile**.

---

## Run Configure

Execute

```bash
./configure \
--with-command-group=nagcmd
```

---

## Command Breakdown

```
./configure
```

Runs the configuration script.

---

```
--with-command-group=nagcmd
```

Specifies the group allowed to execute external Nagios commands.

## End of Part 2B-1

# Part 2B-2 – Compiling and Installing Nagios Core

---

# 19. Compiling Nagios Core

## Objective

After successfully running the `configure` script, the next step is to compile the Nagios source code.

Compilation converts the C source files into executable binaries that Linux can execute.

During compilation, the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) translates thousands of lines of C source code into machine language.

---

# What is Compilation?

Compilation is the process of converting human-readable source code into executable binary files.

```
Source Code (.c)
        │
        ▼
      GCC Compiler
        │
        ▼
 Object Files (.o)
        │
        ▼
     Linker (ld)
        │
        ▼
 Executable Binary
```

Without compilation, the Linux operating system cannot execute the Nagios program.

---

# Compilation Workflow

```
configure
      │
      ▼
 Generate Makefile
      │
      ▼
 make all
      │
      ▼
 GCC Compiler
      │
      ▼
 Object Files
      │
      ▼
 Executables
```

---

# Verify Current Directory

Before compiling, ensure you are inside the Nagios source directory.

```bash
pwd
```

Expected Output

```
/usr/src/nagioscore-nagios-4.5.13
```

---

# Verify Makefile Exists

```bash
ls Makefile
```

Expected

```
Makefile
```

If the Makefile is missing, the configure step did not complete successfully.

---

# Start Compilation

Execute

```bash
make all
```
<img width="960" height="635" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d674b958-2efe-44c0-8bfe-5736416f2928" />

---

# What Does "make all" Do?

The `make` utility reads instructions from the Makefile generated during the configure step.

It automatically compiles every required source file in the correct order.

Internally, the following components are compiled:

```
base/
cgi/
html/
module/
worker/
lib/
```

---

# Compilation Process

```
make all

↓

Compile base/

↓

Compile cgi/

↓

Compile html/

↓

Compile module/

↓

Compile worker/

↓

Link Libraries

↓

Create Executable

↓

Compilation Complete
```

---

# Example Output

```
cd ./base && make

gcc -o nagios

cd ./cgi && make

gcc -o status.cgi

gcc -o history.cgi

cd ./html && make

cd ./worker && make

*** Compile finished ***
```

---

# What Gets Created?

Several executable programs are produced.

Examples

```
nagios

nagiostats

status.cgi

history.cgi

config.cgi

cmd.cgi

summary.cgi
```

---

# Understanding Compilation Messages

During compilation, many messages are displayed.

Example

```
gcc -Wall -g -O2
```

Explanation

| Option | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| gcc | GNU Compiler |
| -Wall | Enable compiler warnings |
| -g | Include debugging symbols |
| -O2 | Optimization level |

---

# Compiler Warnings

Example

```
warning:
```

Warnings do not stop compilation.

Compilation is considered successful if it reaches

```
*** Compile finished ***
```

---

# Compiler Errors

Errors begin with

```
error:
```

Compilation immediately stops.

Example

```
fatal error:

openssl/ssl.h

No such file
```

Solution

```
sudo dnf install openssl-devel
```

---

# Another Common Error

```
gd.h

No such file
```

Solution

```
sudo dnf install gd-devel
```

---

# Verify Compilation

After compilation completes successfully, verify that the executable exists.

```bash
ls base/nagios
```

Expected

```
base/nagios
```

---

# Verify Binary Type

```bash
file base/nagios
```

Expected

```
ELF 64-bit executable
```

---

# Testing Before Installation

Nagios provides a built-in test suite.

Execute

```bash
make test
```

If everything passes, proceed with installation.

---

# Best Practices

✔ Never ignore compiler errors

✔ Warnings are acceptable

✔ Errors must be fixed before installation

---

# 20. Installing Nagios Core

## Objective

Compilation creates executable files.

Installation copies these compiled files into their proper locations on the operating system.

Until installation is performed, Nagios cannot be used.

# End of Part 2B-2

# Part 3A – Installing Nagios Plugins

---

# 21. Installing Nagios Plugins

## Objective

Nagios Core itself is only a monitoring engine.

It **does not directly monitor anything**.

The actual monitoring is performed by **Nagios Plugins**.

Without plugins, Nagios can schedule checks, but it cannot determine whether a host or service is healthy.

Therefore, immediately after installing Nagios Core, the next step is to install the official Nagios Plugins package.

---

# What are Nagios Plugins?

Nagios Plugins are small executable programs that perform monitoring tasks.

Each plugin checks a particular resource and returns one of four standard status codes.

```
                Nagios Core
                     │
                     │ Executes
                     ▼
            Nagios Plugin
                     │
                     │ Checks
                     ▼
          Host / Service Status
                     │
                     ▼
           Status Returned to Core
```

---

## Plugin Return Codes

Every plugin returns one of the following values.

| Return Code | Status | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 0 | OK | Everything is working normally |
| 1 | WARNING | Resource is above warning threshold |
| 2 | CRITICAL | Serious issue detected |
| 3 | UNKNOWN | Plugin could not determine status |

Example

```
check_ping

↓

PING OK

↓

Exit Code = 0
```

---

# Common Plugins

Nagios Plugins package installs many useful monitoring commands.

Examples include:

```
check_ping

check_http

check_disk

check_load

check_users

check_tcp

check_dns

check_procs

check_swap

check_ssh

check_snmp

After downloading the source code, plugins must be compiled.

Compilation converts the plugin source code into executable binaries.

---

# Extract Plugins

```bash
tar -xzf plugins.tar.gz
```

---

Verify

```bash
ls
```

Expected

```
nagios-plugins-2.5
```

---

Enter Directory

```bash
cd nagios-plugins-2.5
```

---

Verify

```bash
pwd
```

Expected

```
/usr/src/nagios-plugins-2.5
```

---

## Configure Plugins

Execute

```bash
./configure \
--with-nagios-user=nagios \

## End of Part 3A

# Part 3B-1 – Web Authentication, Apache Configuration and SELinux

---

# 26. Creating the Web Authentication User

## Objective

Nagios uses **Apache Basic Authentication** to protect the web interface.

Without authentication, anyone who knows the server IP address could access your monitoring dashboard.

For this reason, Nagios requires a valid username and password before allowing access.

## What is Basic Authentication?

Basic Authentication is an HTTP authentication mechanism provided by Apache.

When a user visits the Nagios URL:

```
http://<server-ip>/nagios
```

Apache immediately prompts for a username and password.

Only authenticated users can access the Nagios dashboard.

---

## Authentication File

Nagios stores usernames and encrypted passwords in:

```
/usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users
```

Passwords are **never stored in plain text**.

Example

```
nagiosadmin:$apr1$g2u4...
```

---

# Why Use htpasswd?

Apache provides the `htpasswd` utility to securely create and manage authentication users.

It automatically hashes passwords using secure algorithms.

---

## Verify htpasswd

```bash
which htpasswd
```

Expected

```
/usr/bin/htpasswd
```

If not found

```bash
sudo dnf install httpd-tools
```

---

# Create Web User

Execute

```bash
htpasswd -c /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin
```

---

## Command Explanation

| Option | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| -c | Create new password file |
| htpasswd.users | Password database |
| nagiosadmin | Username |

---

Example

```
New password:

Re-type new password:

Adding password for user nagiosadmin
```

---

# Verify User

```bash
cat /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users
```

Example

```
nagiosadmin:$apr1$.....
```

---

## Add Another User

Do **NOT** use `-c`.

Instead

```bash
htpasswd /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users operator
```

Using `-c` again deletes existing users.

---

## Change Password

```bash
htpasswd /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users nagiosadmin
```

---

## Delete User

```bash
htpasswd -D \
/usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users \
nagiosadmin
```

---

## Authentication File Permissions

Verify

```bash
ls -l /usr/local/nagios/etc/htpasswd.users
```

Expected

```
-rw-r-----
```

---

# Best Practice

Create individual accounts for administrators instead of sharing one account.

Example

```
admin

operator

network

storage

linux
```

---

# 27. Configuring Apache

## Objective

Apache provides the web interface for Nagios.

Without Apache, the dashboard cannot be accessed through a web browser.

# 28. Configuring SELinux

## Objective

SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux) provides mandatory access control for Linux systems.

RHEL enables SELinux by default.

Improper SELinux configuration can prevent Apache and Nagios from functioning correctly.

---

# Verify SELinux Mode

```bash
getenforce
```

Possible Results

```
Enforcing

Permissive

Disabled
```

Recommended

```
Enforcing
```

---

# Check Detailed Status

```bash
sestatus
```

Example

```
SELinux status: enabled

Current mode: enforcing
```

---

# Why Configure SELinux?

Nagios requires Apache to communicate with several directories.

Without proper SELinux policies

```
Permission denied
```

errors may occur.

---

# Allow Apache Network Connections

```bash
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
```

---

## Command Explanation

| Option | Meaning |
|----------|----------|
| setsebool | Change SELinux Boolean |
| -P | Permanent |
| httpd_can_network_connect | Allow Apache outbound connections |

---

# Verify Boolean

```bash
getsebool httpd_can_network_connect
```

Expected

```
on
```

---

# Restore Security Contexts

```bash
restorecon -Rv /usr/local/nagios
```

---

Restore Apache

```bash
restorecon -Rv /etc/httpd
```

---

# Verify Context

```bash
ls -Zd /usr/local/nagios
```

Displays

```
SELinux Context
```

---

# Common SELinux Commands

View Booleans

```bash
getsebool -a
```

---

Temporarily Disable (Testing Only)

```bash
setenforce 0
```

---

Enable Again

```bash
setenforce 1
```

---

⚠ **Never disable SELinux permanently on production servers.**

Always resolve policy issues instead.

---

# Troubleshooting SELinux

## Apache Forbidden

If browser displays

```
403 Forbidden
```

Verify

```
getenforce

restorecon

httpd_can_network_connect
```

---

## Audit Logs

```bash
ausearch -m avc -ts recent
```

Displays recent SELinux denials.

---

## Best Practices

✔ Keep SELinux enabled

✔ Use SELinux Booleans instead of disabling SELinux

✔ Restore contexts after installation

✔ Review audit logs if access is denied

---

## End of Part 3B-1

# Part 3B-2 – Firewalld Configuration, Starting Nagios Services, Verification and First Login

---

# 29. Configuring Firewalld

## Objective

Firewalld is the default firewall management service in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.

Even if Nagios and Apache are installed correctly, users cannot access the web interface unless HTTP or HTTPS traffic is allowed through the firewall.

This section explains how to configure Firewalld securely for Nagios.

---

# What is Firewalld?

Firewalld is a dynamic firewall manager that uses zones to define trust levels for network connections.

Unlike traditional iptables, Firewalld allows firewall rules to be added or removed without restarting the firewall service.

---

## Firewalld Architecture

```

---

# Check Current Firewall Rules

```bash
firewall-cmd --list-all
```

Example Output

```
services:
ssh dhcpv6-client
```

---

# Allow HTTP

```bash
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
```

---

## Command Explanation

| Option | Meaning |
|----------|----------|
| --permanent | Save rule permanently |

# Part 4 – Understanding Nagios Configuration Files

---

# 31. Understanding Nagios Configuration Files

## Objective

Nagios stores all of its monitoring settings in **configuration files (`.cfg`)**. These files define what Nagios monitors, how often checks are performed, which plugins are executed, and who receives notifications.

Without these configuration files, Nagios has no information about the infrastructure it should monitor.

The primary configuration directory is:

```text
/usr/local/nagios/etc/
```

Main configuration files include:

```text
nagios.cfg
cgi.cfg
resource.cfg
objects/
```

---

## Configuration File Hierarchy

```text
/usr/local/nagios/etc
│
├── nagios.cfg          # Main configuration file
├── cgi.cfg             # Web interface configuration
├── resource.cfg        # Resource variables
└── objects/            # Monitoring object definitions
```

---

# 32. Directory Structure Explained

After installation, Nagios is installed under:

```text
/usr/local/nagios/
```

Directory layout:

```text
/usr/local/nagios
│
├── bin/
├── etc/
├── include/
├── libexec/
├── sbin/
├── share/
└── var/
```

---

## Directory Explanation

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **bin** | Contains the Nagios executable (`nagios`) |
| **etc** | Stores all configuration files |
| **include** | Header files used during compilation |
| **libexec** | Stores all Nagios plugins |
| **sbin** | CGI programs used by the web interface |
| **share** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images |
| **var** | Log files, status information, runtime data |

---

## Important Directories

### bin/

Contains the Nagios executable.

Example:

```bash
/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios
```

---

### etc/

Stores configuration files.

Examples:

```text
nagios.cfg
cgi.cfg
resource.cfg
objects/
```

---

### libexec/

Contains monitoring plugins.

Examples:

```text
check_ping
check_http
check_disk
check_load
check_tcp
```

---

### share/

Contains web interface resources.

Examples:

- Images
- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript

---

### var/

Stores runtime information.

Examples:

```text
nagios.log
status.dat
objects.cache
```

---

# 33. Understanding `nagios.cfg`

## What is nagios.cfg?

`nagios.cfg` is the **main configuration file** for Nagios Core.

It tells Nagios:

- Which configuration files to load
- Where logs are stored
- Where plugins are located
- Which object definitions should be read
- Runtime settings

Location:

```text
/usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg
```

---

## View the File

```bash
less /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg
```

---

## Important Parameters

### Log File

```cfg
log_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/nagios.log
```

Specifies where Nagios writes its log messages.

---

### Object Directory

```cfg
cfg_dir=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects
```

Tells Nagios to load every configuration file from the `objects` directory.

---

### Command File

```cfg
command_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/rw/nagios.cmd
```

Used by the web interface to send commands to the Nagios daemon.

Examples:

- Schedule downtime
- Acknowledge alerts
- Restart checks

---

### Status File

```cfg
status_file=/usr/local/nagios/var/status.dat
```

Stores the current status of all hosts and services.

---

### State Retention

```cfg
retain_state_information=1
```

Allows Nagios to remember the previous state after a restart.

---

## Why is nagios.cfg Important?

Think of `nagios.cfg` as the **master configuration file**.

It tells Nagios where every other configuration file is located.

---

# 34. Understanding `cgi.cfg`

## What is cgi.cfg?

`cgi.cfg` controls the Nagios **web interface**.

It defines:

- Authentication
- User permissions
- Administrative access
- Read-only access

Location:

```text
/usr/local/nagios/etc/cgi.cfg
```

---

## View File

```bash
less /usr/local/nagios/etc/cgi.cfg
```

---

## Important Parameters

### Main Administrator

```cfg
authorized_for_system_information=nagiosadmin
```

Allows the specified user to view system information.

---

### Configuration Access

```cfg
authorized_for_configuration_information=nagiosadmin
```

Allows viewing configuration through the web interface.

---

### Service Commands

```cfg
authorized_for_all_service_commands=nagiosadmin
```

Allows:

- Restart checks
- Disable notifications
- Schedule downtime

---

### Host Commands

```cfg
authorized_for_all_host_commands=nagiosadmin
```

Allows host-related administrative actions.

---

## How Authentication Works

```

```

---

# 35. Understanding `resource.cfg`

## What is resource.cfg?

`resource.cfg` stores reusable variables and sensitive information.

Instead of hardcoding passwords in plugins, Nagios references variables stored in this file.

Location:

```text
/usr/local/nagios/etc/resource.cfg
```

---

## View File

```bash
less /usr/local/nagios/etc/resource.cfg
```

---

## Common Variables

### USER1

```cfg
$USER1$=/usr/local/nagios/libexec
```

Points to the Nagios plugins directory.

Example:

```cfg
command_line $USER1$/check_ping
```

Instead of writing:

```cfg
/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_ping
```

Nagios replaces `$USER1$` automatically.

---

### USER2

Example:

```cfg
$USER2$=public
```

Can store an SNMP community string.

---

### USER3

Example:

```cfg
$USER3$=database_password
```

Can store database credentials.

---

## Why Use Variables?

Benefits:

- Avoid hardcoding passwords
- Easier maintenance
- Reusable configuration
- Improved security

---

## Example

Instead of:

```cfg
command_line /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_snmp -C public
```

Use:

```cfg
command_line $USER1$/check_snmp -C $USER2$
```

This makes future password changes much easier.

---

# Summary

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **nagios.cfg** | Main Nagios configuration |
| **cgi.cfg** | Web interface permissions |
| **resource.cfg** | Variables and credentials |
| **objects/** | Hosts, services, contacts, commands |

---

## Configuration Relationship

```text
                nagios.cfg
                     │
        ┌────────────┼────────────┐
        │            │            │
        ▼            ▼            ▼
   cgi.cfg     resource.cfg    objects/
                                    │
                    ┌───────────────┼────────────────┐
                    ▼               ▼                ▼
              commands.cfg    contacts.cfg    localhost.cfg
```

---

## Best Practices

- Keep configuration files backed up.
- Do not store plain-text passwords in command definitions.
- Use `resource.cfg` for sensitive variables.
- Validate changes before restarting Nagios:

```bash
/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg
```

A successful validation should end with:

```text
Things look okay - No serious problems were detected during the pre-flight check.
```
